============

# Java code for a basic program

## 1 first idea = a changing pallete of color. As in, a colorized graphic that rapidly changes color as you either type on the keyboard or move the mouse around.

## idea 2 = some sort of card-based game. Probably something simple like Blackjack or something similar.

## idea 3 = a die roller simulation game. A die simulator, you select a die type, and you can sort out arithmetic calculations you wish to be effected by that die roll.
